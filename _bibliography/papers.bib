  title={Capital Inflow Shocks and Convenience Yields},
  author={Ben Zeev, Nadav and Ben-Z'eev, Noam and Nathan, Daniel},
 abstract={We use novel daily transaction data on Israeli sovereign bonds to identify exogenous inflow shocks from large foreign financial institutions' idiosyncratic trading decisions. These shocks raise short-term convenience yields by up to 8.7 bps, explaining a substantial portion of the gap. We show the effects extend across markets and are amplified through a portfolio rebalancing channel: longer-term convenience yields increase by up to 8.1 bps, corporate spreads decline by up to 31.6 bps, and equities rise by 5.7%. Our findings highlight a channel through which global capital flows shape convenience yields, monetary policy.},

  title={China Walls},
  author={Lee, Tomy and Nathan, Daniel and Wang, Chaojun},
 abstract={We evaluate the enforcement of information barriers—China Walls—within conglomerates. Our setting is the 23 million trades in 2019-2024 in the Israeli Shekel market, where the US SEC imposes China Walls around dealers. Our difference-in-differences design compares the trade volumes and profits of funds that are affiliated with, clients of, or entirely unrelated to a dealer around the days when the dealer is especially likely to hold valuable information. Dealers never trade or share information with their affiliate funds, despite that they do share information with their clients, and funds within the same conglomerate do so among themselves. Our findings persist in crisis and noncrisis periods and across granular cells of fund and asset characteristics. From a back-of-the- envelope calculation, imposing China Walls around funds would eliminate $23.7 billion in trades. We reveal a remarkable regulatory capacity to control information flows within conglomerates.},

  title={The Perfect Storm: Bank of Israel’s Forex Interventions, Global Banks’ Limited Risk-Bearing Capacity, Deviations from Covered Interest Parity, and the Impact on the USD/ILS Options Market},
  author={Hertrich, Markus and Nathan, Daniel},
  abstract={Using confidential daily foreign exchange interventions (FXI) data, we analyse the FXI episode of the Bank of Israel (BOI) from 2013 to 2019. We find that a purchase of US dollar (USD) 1 billion is on average associated with a depreciation of the Israeli new shekel (ILS) by 0.82%-0.83%, which is at the upper bound of the estimated impact in other studies. We show that this effectiveness can be explained by global financial intermediaries' limited risk-taking capacity. The (indirect) effect on the forward rate is smaller-the BOI's USD purchases have widened the negative deviation from covered interest parity. This widening remains significant over 90 days. Contrary to the findings in earlier empirical literature, the higher moments of the risk-neutral probability distribution of future spot exchange rates are also affected. The USD purchases shift the whole distribution towards higher USD/ILS values while reducing crash risk. We also find that the USD/ILS options market partially anticipates intervention episodes and prices them in before they occur.},

  title={Decomposing the Term Structure of Interests Rates: Evidence from a Small Open Economy},
  author={Nathan, Daniel},
 abstract={This paper uses Israeli data of inflation-indexed and nominal government bonds to estimate a discrete-time essentially affine term structure model. To estimate the model, I use a uniquely long-spanned sample of monthly real yields for the period of 01/1985-03/2018. The nominal yields data spans the period of 05/2001-03/2018. I document an unconditional upward sloping real term structure that the model ascribes to a rising real term premium while the average expected real short rates are relatively flat. A decomposition of the break-even inflation shows that the unconditional term structure of the inflation premium is increasing with maturity and most of the variance in the short end is due to expected inflation. However, in the long end, most of it is due to the inflation term premium.},
