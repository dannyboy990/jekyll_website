  title={China Walls},
  author={Lee, Tomy and Nathan, Daniel and Chaojun, Wang},
abstract={Conflicts of interest are inherent to banking conglomerates. Regulators increasingly manage these conflicts by enforcing China Walls-internal information barriers around key affiliates, in particular, dealers. We map the information sharing among the dealers and funds using the universe of foreign exchange transactions involving the Israeli Shekel to evaluate if today's China Walls are effectively enforced. We employ a difference-in-differences design comparing affiliates to entirely unconnected firms around exceptionally large trades to measure information sharing, and exploit the structure of this market to verify our design. We document islands of informational autarky between the affiliate dealers and funds surrounded by a sea of information sharing: (1) The affiliate dealers and funds never trade and do not share information with each other. (2) The dealers and funds connected via trading relationships systemically share information, including on days when the dealer and the fund happen to not trade with each other. (3) Affiliate funds without China Walls intensely share information among themselves. (4) Our results hold during crisis and noncrisis periods, and across granular cells of firm and asset characteristics. Our results reveal remarkable regulatory capacity to control information flows between wholly aligned firms.},

  title={Exchanges for Government Bonds? Evidence during COVID-19},
  author={Kutai, Ari and Nathan, Daniel and Wittwer, Milena},
abstract={We leverage the unique institutional feature that the Israeli government bond market operates on an exchange rather than over-the-counter to analyze whether and why having an exchange affects market liquidity during a crisis. We document how the liquidity crisis in March 2020 affected the Israeli government bond market, and conduct difference-in-differences analyses, comparing bid-ask spreads in exchange markets (such as the Israeli government bond and U.S. future market) with markets lacking an exchange (like the U.S. government bond market). Our findings support the idea that having an exchange enhances market liquidity. A counterfactual analysis using trade data from the Israeli exchange suggests that this is due to the ability of investors to readily provide liquidity to one another and the efficient netting of trade flows on an exchange.},

  title={The Perfect Storm: Bank of Israel’s Forex Interventions, Global Banks’ Limited Risk-Bearing Capacity, Deviations from Covered Interest Parity, and the Impact on the USD/ILS Options Market},
  author={Hertrich, Markus and Nathan, Daniel},
  abstract={Using confidential daily foreign exchange interventions (FXI) data, we analyse the FXI episode of the Bank of Israel (BOI) from 2013 to 2019. We find that a purchase of US dollar (USD) 1 billion is on average associated with a depreciation of the Israeli new shekel (ILS) by 0.82%-0.83%, which is at the upper bound of the estimated impact in other studies. We show that this effectiveness can be explained by global financial intermediaries' limited risk-taking capacity. The (indirect) effect on the forward rate is smaller-the BOI's USD purchases have widened the negative deviation from covered interest parity. This widening remains significant over 90 days. Contrary to the findings in earlier empirical literature, the higher moments of the risk-neutral probability distribution of future spot exchange rates are also affected. The USD purchases shift the whole distribution towards higher USD/ILS values while reducing crash risk. We also find that the USD/ILS options market partially anticipates intervention episodes and prices them in before they occur.},

  title={Decomposing the Term Structure of Interests Rates: Evidence from a Small Open Economy},
  author={Nathan, Daniel},
 abstract={This paper uses Israeli data of inflation-indexed and nominal government bonds to estimate a discrete-time essentially affine term structure model. To estimate the model, I use a uniquely long-spanned sample of monthly real yields for the period of 01/1985-03/2018. The nominal yields data spans the period of 05/2001-03/2018. I document an unconditional upward sloping real term structure that the model ascribes to a rising real term premium while the average expected real short rates are relatively flat. A decomposition of the break-even inflation shows that the unconditional term structure of the inflation premium is increasing with maturity and most of the variance in the short end is due to expected inflation. However, in the long end, most of it is due to the inflation term premium.},
