Employing unique daily data on Israeli IIs’ foreign exchange (FX) forward flows, we find that a one standard deviation global equity market shock generates significant and persistent selling of US dollar forwards by IIs, as a hedge against heightened FX exposure, along with significant and persistent exchange rate appreciation. To reinforce the causal interpretation of our findings, we use both a granular instrumental variable estimation approach as well as a Bartik instrument one to show that IIs’ hedging demand shocks induce significant exchange rate appreciation.}, year={2024}, dimensions={true}, selected={true},

  title={The Widening of Cross-Currency Basis: When Increased FX Swap Demand Meets a Shortage of Global Arbitrage Capital},
  author={Nathan, Daniel and Ben Zeev, Nadav},
abstract={This paper examines customer demand-side factors that affect deviation from covered interest rate parity (CIP) with respect to the dollar (i.e., cross-currency basis), particularly when arbitrageurs are constrained. Using novel detailed daily transaction-level data on the universe of Israeli institutional investors (IIs), we employ a granular instrumental variable (GIV) estimation to investigate how IIs’ FX swap demand affects CIP deviation. Our findings demonstrate that a one standard deviation shock to IIs’ FX swap demand when capital is abundant has a null effect on IIs’ basis. However, when capital is scarce, the demand shock produces significant and persistent reduction of 3.9-8.4 basis points in IIs’ basis, remaining significant for over 500 trading days.Our results, which are unchanged when we consider the complementary and popularized Bartik instrument approach instead of the GIV one, showcase how limits of arbitrage, together with demand shocks from a large customer base, can drive CIP deviations.},

  title={Mutual Fund Flows and Government Bond Returns},
  abbr={Lead Article, JBF},
  author={Abudy, Menachem Meni and Nathan, Daniel and Wohl, Avi},
  abstract={We investigate daily flows to Israeli government bonds mutual funds, which are held primarily by retail investors. We divide the bonds into six categories: nominal/CPI-linked; short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term maturity. We find that daily net flows are contemporaneously correlated with price changes of all categories. These price changes are economically significant and they subsequently reverse fully or mostly within 10 trading days. The price reversal indicates that the initial price changes are due to “noise.” We also find that these price distortions affect break-even inflation—a popular measure of inflation expectations. Our findings indicate that even securities that are held by institutions and professional investors are affected by retail sentiment.},
