  abstract={We investigate daily flows to Israeli government bonds mutual funds, which are held primarily by retail investors. We divide the bonds into six categories: nominal/CPI-linked; short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term maturity. We find that daily net flows are contemporaneously correlated with price changes of all categories. These price changes are economically significant and they subsequently reverse fully or mostly within 10 trading days. The price reversal indicates that the initial price changes are due to “noise.” We also find that these price distortions affect break-even inflation—a popular measure of inflation expectations. Our findings indicate that even securities that are held by institutions and professional investors are affected by retail sentiment.},

  abbr={Forthcoming}, title={Shorting the Dollar When Global Stock Markets Roar: The Equity Hedging Channel of Exchange Rate Determination}, author={Ben Zeev, Nadav and Nathan, Daniel}, abstract={This paper investigates the influence of global equity market shocks on institutional investors’ (IIs’) hedging behavior and the resulting effects on exchange rates. Employing unique daily data on Israeli IIs’ foreign exchange (FX) forward flows, we find that a one standard deviation global equity market shock generates significant and persistent selling of US dollar forwards by IIs, as a hedge against heightened FX exposure, along with significant and persistent exchange rate appreciation. To reinforce the causal interpretation of our findings, we use both a granular instrumental variable estimation approach as well as a Bartik instrument one to show that IIs’ hedging demand shocks induce significant exchange rate appreciation.}, year={2024}, dimensions={true}, selected={true},
