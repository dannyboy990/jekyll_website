Welcome to my website and thanks for visiting!

I am a **Senior Research Economist** at the Monetary Department of the **Bank of Israel**. Currently, I am on leave and a **visiting scholar at Wharton** during the academic years 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. 

I completed my PhD in Finance at **Tel-Aviv University in 2022**. My primary area of interest lies in exploring the intersection between **finance and macroeconomics**, and find great satisfaction in conducting research in this field.
