I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)**, which I joined in 2025. My research sits at the intersection of finance and macroeconomics, with particular focus on exchange rates, monetary policy transmission, and international capital flows.

Previously, I was a Senior Research Economist in the **Monetary Department at the Bank of Israel** (2007â€“2025) and a Visiting Scholar at **The Wharton School** (2022â€“2024) sponsored by Itay Goldstein. I completed my PhD in Finance at **Tel-Aviv University** in 2022, and I am a member of the **Macro Finance Society**.

My work has appeared in leading journals, including **Management Science**, **Journal of International Economics**, and **Review of Asset Pricing Studies**.
