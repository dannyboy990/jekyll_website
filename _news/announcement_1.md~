I'll be at the FMA conference in Chicago on October 13th and 14th. I'll be presenting our paper titled "The Persistent Widening of Cross-Currency Basis: When Increased FX Swap Demand Meets a Shortage of Global Arbitrage Capital", co-authored with Nadav Ben Zeev. Additionally, I'll be chairing the "Trading and Frictions in Global Markets" session.
